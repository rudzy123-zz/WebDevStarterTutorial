<p><br>Once you master the basics of authoring HTML, you&rsquo;ll need focus on what your next steps will be.</br> <br>If you&rsquo;re an aspiring web designer, you&rsquo;ll need to dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</br> <br>If you&rsquo;re maintaining a corporate or personal site through a CMS, you&rsquo;ll need to focus on how the CMS works, and the most efficient ways to edit and maintain content.</br> <br>On this page I&rsquo;ll give you some basic advice on how to approach learning web design and point you towards additional resources that can help you along the way.</br></p>
<h1>Learning Web Design</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Web design&rdquo; is a pretty open-ended term. Often people who are new to web design feel overwhelmed at everything there is to learn. <br>That&rsquo;s understandable, but just remember that it&rsquo;s like any other discipline; with proper dedication and focus you&rsquo;ll progress quickly.</br> <br>Here&rsquo;s my favorite advice to new web designers on learning web design:</br></p>
<p><br>Learn how the web works.</br>
  <br>I&rsquo;m always amazed at how many web designers focus on learning &ldquo;just what they need to know&rdquo; and ignore how the web actually works.</br> <br>Without understanding how <em>web servers, protocols, browsers, and other related web technology works</em>, you&rsquo;ll never really understand the context behind why you do the things you do, and what makes one practice better than another.</br></p>
<p>Determine an area of focus, and start there.<br />
  <br>There are a lot of areas of web design that you could specialize in, so I&rsquo;d recommend <em>learning as much about them as you can,</em> to determine which areas interest you. <br />Then, spend as much time learning about your specific area of focus as possible. <br />Once you achieve a level of proficiency, begin to <em>branch out into other areas as well</em>. </p>
<p><em>Never stop learning</em>
  <br />The web is constantly evolving. <br />Even if you become the absolute best there is in a specific field, chances are new techniques and approaches will come along within the year that will make your current skill set less desirable. <br />Understand that being a good web designer means embracing the changing nature of the web.</p>
<p><em>Break things!</em>
    <br />There is no better teacher than experience. <br />Build and experiment constantly. Ask yourself, &ldquo;what would happen if I?...&rdquo; or &ldquo;wonder if I could build?...&rdquo; and then go out and build it. <br />If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll fail a good bit of the time, but the process of trying things and breaking them will make you that much better. <br /><em>Always challenge yourself.</em></p>
